# HOM25PharseTech
This repository contains code used during HackOMania 2025 by Team PharseTech, organised by GeeksHacking
## Project Description:
Our team sought to create Geek Connect - Find Your Tribe IRL, a dynamic and inclusive platform that empowers geeks to connect with like-minded peers, building a community that blends the best of virtual interactions and real-world engagement, and celebrates geek culture! Our approach to building communities first groups users based on their location. Then, based on a users' declared preferences, tribes sharing similar hobbies and learning interests are recommended, allowing a user to explore its' members profiles to find the tribe that suits them best! By leveraging Google Maps' Geocoding API, we convert the users' towns into geographical coordinates, grouping users staying in close proximity into large communities. These communities are then broken down into smaller tribes of 6-11 based on users' declared preferences.  Tribe sizes are managed by platform administrators, and volunteers can be recruited to help maintain the site, with fundraising for more servers and skilled developers as a scaling option. 

Additionally, an events tab provides a diverse range of activities for all, ensuring continuous engagement beyond tribe participation.  To encourage user growth and interaction, users can host their own events, or share links to ongoing local events to be promoted on the platform,  facilitating team formation and fostering a greater sense of belonging amongst members.

## Tech Stack: 
Our project leverages a robust tech stack to create a seamless and intelligent tribe-matching platform. Python powers our unsupervised learning algorithm, analyzing user input to recommend the most compatible tribe groups. PHP serves as the backbone of our web application, handling user interactions, authentication, and business logic efficiently. Meanwhile, SQL manages the structured storage of user profiles, tribe data, and event details, ensuring quick and reliable access to information. Together, this stack enables dynamic matchmaking, smooth user experiences, and a well-organized database to support real-world geek connections.
